## üìñ Overview

This project is divided into 4 main phases:

1. **Web Scraping** eBay reviews using Selenium.
2. **Data Cleaning + Sentiment Analysis + Visualization** using TextBlob and Matplotlib/Seaborn.
3. **Feature Engineering** using BERT embeddings and handcrafted features.
4. **Model Training** using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

## üöÄ Project Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Web Scraping

- Uses Selenium to scrape:
  - Review title
  - Review content
  - Ratings
- Stores data into `ebay_reviews.csv`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Sentiment Analysis + EDA

- Cleans review text
- Applies TextBlob to extract sentiment polarity
- Visualizes:
  - Word clouds
  - Review length distributions
  - Word counts

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Feature Engineering

- BERT embeddings from `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Sentiment polarity score
- Negation count (to detect sarcasm)

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Model Training & Evaluation

- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Best model saved as `classifier.pkl`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Scraping:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup
- **NLP:** NLTK, TextBlob, Sentence-Transformers
- **ML Models:** Scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
